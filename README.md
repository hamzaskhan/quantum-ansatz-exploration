# **Quantum Ansatz Exploration**  
Explore how the complexity of variational quantum circuits (ansatz) impacts the performance of quantum machine learning models on real-world datasets.

---

## **Overview**  
This project dives into the fascinating world of **quantum machine learning** (QML), using **Google Cirq** to experiment with **simple** and **complex ansatz designs**. Through this, we aim to understand the relationship between ansatz complexity and classification performance, while maintaining execution efficiency.

In this repository, you will:  
- Train a quantum classifier on datasets with different ansatz configurations.  
- Visualize and compare performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.  
- Learn how to design and tweak ansatz circuits to optimize quantum models.  

Whether you're a beginner in QML or exploring advanced concepts, this project is designed to **educate, inspire, and simplify learning** quantum computing concepts.
